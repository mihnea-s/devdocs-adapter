# DevDocs Adapter

Use **[devdocs.io](devdocs.io)** documentation directly in VSCode!

![A demo video showing the use of the extension](https://github.com/mihnea-s/devdocs-adapter/raw/main/demo.gif)

## Usage

Use the command `DevDocs: Manage DocSets` to select which docsets to download and install, or manually
set their slug IDs in your preferences and reload:

```json
{
    "devdocs-adapter.docsets": [ "javascript", "rust" ]
}
```

Now you can use the search command `DevDocs: Search documentation`, or the keyboard shortcut `Alt + P`, to
search for items in your docsets!
